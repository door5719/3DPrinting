The programming is done in C++ with Visualization Toolkit(VTK) toolbox.
How to execute:

1.Place the main.cpp file inside the vtk.
2.Also place two other files "head.vtk" and  "icbm.mnc" which are the input files.
3.In the program change the output path of the program i.e  default path is std::string outputSTLFile = "C:\\Users\\ds168.CS\\Desktop\\brainOut.stl";
After executing the program,the STL file is  generated in the given path.
4.Start the program exeution, then:
Screen prompts to enter vtk or mnc
after entering mnc or vtk the output file is generated and alos displayed in vtk render window.
5. We can also increase and decrease the counter value by pressing "i" or "d" on the keyboard.


6. After dislaying the STL file you can also view the STL file using chrome add on 3DView.
